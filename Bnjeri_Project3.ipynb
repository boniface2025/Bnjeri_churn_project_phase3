    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "This report presents the development of a machine learning classifier to predict customer churn for SyriaTel, a telecommunications company. The primary objective is to identify patterns that can help predict whether a customer will discontinue using the company's services. Early identification of such customers enables SyriaTel to take proactive measures to retain them.\n",
    "## General Objective of the Project: \n",
    "To create a classifier that identifies customers likely to discontinue SyriaTel services in the near termâ€”enabling proactive retention actions before cancellation occurs?\n",
    "## Specific Objective: \n",
    "1. Build a binary classification model to predict whether a customer will churn (`True`) or not (`False`) using customer usage and service-related data.\n",
    "2. Uncover treatment strategies: Use model outputs to guide proactive retention efforts.\n",
    "3. Draw business conclusions based on the model analysis"
